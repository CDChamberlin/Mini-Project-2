# Mini-Project-2
The second mini project

The purpose of the Mini Project is to reinforce skills that have been covered in recent modules. We have covered React in Modules 6 and at the start of 7.  Incorporate these skills into a mini project that you'd be proud to show off on your portfolio!  
Use the existing work you have and convert it to React -OR- create a new mini project!
Consider a topic you feel strongly interested in, a hobby, an issue at work.  This could be in addition to your Capstone project. Prepare and present a 10-minute presentation in class to get practice demonstrating and speaking about your work.

NOTE: Presentation is required so we can 1). Ensure you get practice, and 2.) Grade your work

## Minimal Viable Project
[ ]Create Application Flow (Simple: landing page, login page, dashboard) <-- Write notes here first! Why are you doing it?
[ ]Generate a LoFi Figma
[ ]Code it up React Components/Structure (Three pages: landing, sign up/login, and dashboard are minimum)

## Goals
[ ] HiFi Figma
[ ] Use design framework like Material UI
[ ] Add more pages, flesh out your app more (3 pages minimum)
[ ] Use axios or fetch to get data from third party API (research free apis that are relevant to your app)
[ ] Use BrowserRouting (discussed in late Module 7 slides) to connect pages (landing -> login -> dashboard)
